    <p>Hi {{ FullName . }},</p>
    <p>
        <span>A request was made to recover your account. You can recover your account by</span>
        <a href="{{ RecoveryURL . }}">clicking here</a><span>.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        When you click on the link above, you will be directed to the account
        management area. If you have permanently lost the ability to log in
        normally, you may need to unlink, and then re-link your authentication
        method. Here are the steps to do that:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Find your normal authentication method under the
            "Authentication Methods" header.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press the delete button next to your normal authentication method.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will be prompted to confirm the deletion by entering the name
            of the authentication method. Do this,
            then press the "Delete" button.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once again, find your normal authentication method under the
            "Authentication Methods" header.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the "Link" button and, depending on the authentication mechanism,
            choose new values for your authentication.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you did not make this request, you can ignore this email.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks,
    </p>
